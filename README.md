Brewing Salt Calculator - a calculator for the water chemistry of brewing beer.

## What
Brewers often want to alter their water chemistry, either entirely from scratch with reverse osmosis as the base, or tweaking their tap's supply. These mineral additions can dramatically change the flavor of the beer.
## Why
While these calculations are straight-forward, doing them by hand is laborious. Software solutions exist already, but none that meet my needs. [Beersmith](http://beersmith.com), an excellent product, includes water chemistry calculations, but the interface isn't ideal. [Bru'n Water](https://www.brunwater.com) is the gold standard that I'm aware of, but as it's literally an Excel file, it a. requires Excel (it doesn't run very well in FOSS offerings) b. is clunky c. has no cloud storage.
## How
As I want this to be as easy as possible to use across platforms, I intend to make this a web app. It will utilize Javascript with some framework for the frontend, and various cloud (probably AWS) platforms for the backend.
## FOSS
This will be my first attempt at monetizing software. I am making the source code freely available under the Mozilla Public License 2.0, so if you wish to run it on your own, you're free to do so, within the limits of the license. If you'd rather have someone run the infrastructure for you, I can do that.
